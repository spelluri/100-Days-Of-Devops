# 💯 100 Days of DevOps Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfDevOps** journey!  
This repository documents my daily progress as I learn, practice, and implement real-world DevOps concepts and tools — one day at a time.  

---

## 🎯 Objective

To strengthen my hands-on DevOps skills by completing one focused task every day for 100 days.  
Each day covers a practical scenario — from Linux administration to CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, infrastructure automation, and cloud operations.

## 🌱 Motivation

> “DevOps is not a toolset, it’s a mindset.”  

This challenge is part of my continuous learning path as a **DevOps Engineer**.  
I’m documenting each task to build consistency, share knowledge, and demonstrate hands-on expertise with modern DevOps tools and practices.

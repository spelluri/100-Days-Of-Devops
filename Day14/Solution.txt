Step 1 : Check in which app servers apache is not running .
sudo systemctl status httpd #run this cmd in all the app servers.
#if apache is running . check which port its listening to .
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 6300
or
sudo ss -tulnp | grep 6300

Step 2: Issue 
a. httpd was not running in stapp01 server . 
b. Some other process was listening on port 6300 .

# check which process is listening on port 6300 .
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 6300
OR
sudo ss -tulpn | grep 6300

# get the name of process listening on port 6300.
sudo lsof -i :6300

#stop the conflicting process
in this case the othe rprocess listening on port 6300 is sendmail
sudo systemctl stop sendmail
sudo systemctl disable sendmail

#Restart Apache.
sudo systemctl restart httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

#Verify apache is listening on port 6300.
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 6300
or 
sudo ss -tulpn | grep 6300

Step 3: Resolution 
a. Port 6300 was taken by sendmail process , so apache couldnt bind to 6300.
b. stop or move sendmail process to another port and restart apache . Apache now runs on 6300 port .

## How to Remember These Commands

Here's a memory trick using **stories and patterns**:

### The Command Structure Pattern
```
iptables -[ACTION] [CHAIN] [OPTIONS] -j [TARGET]
eg: sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s $LBR_IP --dport $PORT -j ACCEPT (Traffic coming in to your lbr host through protocol tcp and port 8089 should be allowed )
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport $PORT -j DROP ( Traffic coming in to all other host through protocol tcp and port 8089 should be silently ignored )

Think: "A Cat Often Jumps Through"

A = Action (what to do)
C = Chain (where to apply it)
O = Options (the details)
J = Jump/Target (what happens when matched)

Key Letters to Remember
-A = Append (add to end of list)
-I = Insert (add to beginning)
-D = Delete
-L = List
-F = Flush (clear everything)
Chains (think of the flow of traffic):

INPUT = traffic coming IN to your server
OUTPUT = traffic going OUT from your server
FORWARD = traffic passing THROUGH your server (routing)

Common Options:

-p = protocol (tcp, udp, icmp)
--dport = destination port (where it's going)
--sport = source port (where it came from)

Targets (-j):

ACCEPT = let it through
DROP = silently ignore
REJECT = block and tell them it's blocked

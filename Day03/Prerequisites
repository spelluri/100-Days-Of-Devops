Prerequisites

SSH access to all app servers with a non-root user account
Sudo privileges on all target servers
At least one terminal session open during configuration (to avoid lockout)
List of all app servers in Stratos Datacenter

Security Background
Direct root SSH login poses significant security risks:

Brute Force Attacks: Root is a known username, making it easier for attackers to attempt password guessing
Audit Trail: Direct root login makes it harder to track which administrator performed specific actions
Privilege Escalation Control: Requiring sudo provides an additional layer of authentication and logging

Best Practice: Users should log in with personal accounts and use sudo for administrative tasks.
